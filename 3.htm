color:#323232'>The game takes place on an average level of difficulty. After
the start, follow the location. Kill the enemies and collect the four
characters of Jumanji. The market area is not too large, so you will not get
lost here. The green arrow of the character indicates in which direction the
characters are. Also shoot at vessels with liquids that are found on roofs.
They will allow you to score points. Collect &nbsp;four characters and move on.</span></p>

color:#323232'>Activate the obelisk and destroy the enemies. Large thugs will
appear. It’s better to kill them before they can approach you. Collect boxes
with weapons charges. When the bar is filled in the upper left corner of the
screen, you can go further.</span></p>

color:#323232'>Go through the cave by collecting the figures of Jumanji. Just
calculate the correct time to overcome the floor with spikes and swinging axes.</span></p>

color:#323232'>Next will be another location with enemies. It is necessary to
collect Jumanji figures. To kill the thugs faster, aim at their head. One of
the figures is hidden behind a fence near a rhino. You cannot kill him, and it
can kill hero.</span></p>

Blue boxes give ammunition for weapons, purple – grenades.</span></p>

color:#323232'>And again there will be a segment with the collection of figures
of Jumanji. Please note that here you will need to climb wooden boards. Go
through another cave. Watch for the spikes that appear alternately in a
checkerboard pattern. In the end you will find a difficult battle. Stay with
the whole team near the obelisk. So the scale fills in the upper left corner of
the screen.</span></p>

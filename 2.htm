luminous object above the entrance to the room, and then collect the four
figures and take them to the door. Fight enemies using various tricks. When you
are asked to give life to a teammate, then pay attention to the icons in the
lower left corner of the screen. There are images of comrades, but one of them
died (heart shape). Hold “1” and you will see how the dial is filled.</span></p>
